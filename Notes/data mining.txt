data mining

is not:
- querying data
- just statistical analysis
- not just big data
- 

Components:
Databases -> grown very big  -> moving data effect, manage data
Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning
Statistics: how to automate it -> fast(tricky algorithms)

Books: 
collective intelligence (Segaran)
introduction to data mining (tan, steinbach, kumar)

Math:
- Statistics
- Linear Algebra
- Probability(eg. bayesian etc)

4 families
- cluster analysis (groups)
	-> K-means clustering
	-> hierarchial agglomerative clustering ()
- classification (categorization, predictive)
---> dsecision tree
---> bayesian(probability based), ANN
- anomaly detection 
---> similarity metrics
- association analysis
---> market basket data/ "a priori" algorithm
