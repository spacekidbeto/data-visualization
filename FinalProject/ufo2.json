Clear skies.  Moved at a normal speed but was no higher than a small spray plane.  Had no blinking lights.It moved over the city in which we live.  The light from ground view was the size of a tennis ball.  We thought it was a firework at first, we were facing south and it kept coming north and went right over us and our house.  We watched till it faded out of sight."}
